# Arduino-Robotic-Arm
Arduino Uno robotic arm using joystick input
Had some spare servos and salvaged a broken controller for joysticks, decided to make a robotic arm. Had to put some spare metal to the base for extra heft so it won't tip over so easily. Going to replace the sg90 servos with metal gearbox ones soon, big ones already are. This is also the first project i have coded completly by myself. Joysticks cahnge the servo position values so they hold position and won't come back when you let go.

If anyone knows a better crapple system or way to make it move than servos, hmu, it doesn't close and open as well as i'd like.

Also if anyone knows how i can translate a potentiometer input better than adding on 520/10 then also let me know, the graplle up down movement is limited currently by it (50-150Â° about from the top of my head).
